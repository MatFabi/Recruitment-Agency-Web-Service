# Spring-Hibernate-JSP-JS-Project

Recruitment agency web service with form to place announcements.
Working on SignUp and Login using Spring Security.
The core of the project is to learn how are working: Spring, Hibernate, JSP.
I am also trying to understand MVC design pattern.
Front-end site is not done yet, now I am staying focused on back-end.
