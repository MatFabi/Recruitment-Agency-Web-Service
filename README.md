# Spring-Hibernate-JSP-JS-Project


Recruitment agency web service.
Adding announcements is allowed for specified, checked users.
It is possible to register new user, with automatically added "unchecked" status.
Atuhentication is held by Spring security.
Preview is based on local storage, so it is possible to make preview page in new tab.

The core of the project is to learn how: Spring, Hibernate, JSP works.
I am also trying to understand MVC design pattern.
Front-end site is not done yet, I am staying focused on back-end.
